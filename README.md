# CSCB20 Course Website
## What it Does
This website helps course instructors manage their classes by displaying, storing, and retrieving information such as grades, assignments, and announcements between instructors and students. It also allows instructors to efficiently organize and update student grades by categorizing them by assignments or exams. Additionally, the website includes authentication and authorization features to enhance security.

## How we built it
**Frontend** - Our frontend is built with HTML/CSS, Javascript and JQuery.

**Backend** - Our project uses Python Flask as the foundation, along with additional libraries such as BCrypt, Blueprint and SQLAlchemy to support handling authentication/authorization, modulize the code and interact with the database. 

**Database** - We use SQLite to store user information and other necessary data for the website.

## Challenges We Ran Into
One of the significant challenges we faced was effective communication between frontend and backend developers. Differences in UI design choices often complicate backend implementation. To address this, we implemented regular meetings to collaboratively decide on the website's design and structure. This approach ensured that both frontend and backend developers were aligned in their efforts, leading to a more cohesive final product.

## What We Learned
- Collaborating and communication in a team
- Efficiently organizing and planning project from scratch  
- Using version control system Git that track version of source code
- Polished and advanced user design by raw HTML, CSS
- Integrated Flask and Javascript to seamless client-server communication
  
## What's Next?
Our goal is to further enhance the website's functionality to meetreal-world requirements. One of the key features we plan to implement is a search function, allowing users to easily find specific content within the website. Additionally, we aim to expand the website's capabilities to support the upload of various file types, such as images, text files, and videos, for lectures. Furthermore, we plan to incorporate a feature that enables instructors to view students' work alongside regrade requests, providing them with valuable context when evaluating these
